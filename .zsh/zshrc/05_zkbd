## zkbd helps defining human-friendly keymap names by sourcing a properly named
## file from ~/.zsh/zkbd

## A file is created by calling zkbd if there doesn't exist one for the current
##triple: $TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE

autoload zkbd # && [[ ! -f ~/.zsh/zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE ]] && zkbd
[[ -f ~/.zsh/zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE ]] && source ~/.zsh/zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE || source ~/.zsh/zkbd/xterm-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE
